## Introduction

**nf-core/references** is a bioinformatics pipeline that build references, for multiple use cases.

It is primarily designed to build references for common organisms and store it on [AWS iGenomes](https://github.com/ewels/AWS-iGenomes/).

From a fasta file, it will be able to build the following references:

- Bowtie1 index
- Bowtie2 index
- BWA-MEM index
- BWA-MEM2 index
- DRAGMAP hashtable
- Fasta dictionary (with GATK4)
- Fasta fai (with SAMtools)
- Fasta sizes (with SAMtools)
- Fasta intervals bed (with GATK4)
- MSIsensor-pro list

With an additional annotation file describing the genes (either GFF3 or GTF), it will be able to build the following references:

- GTF (from GFF3 with GFFREAD)
- HISAT2 index
- Kallisto index
- RSEM index
- Salmon index
- Splice sites (with HISAT2)
- STAR index
- Transcript fasta (with RSEM)

With a vcf file, it will compress it, if it was not already compressed, and tabix index it.

## Datasheets

Datasheets are stored in [references-datasheets](https://github.com/nf-core/references-datasheets).

## Running

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow.Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

`asset.yml`:

```yml
- genome: GRCh38_chr21
  fasta: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/references/references/GRCh38_chr21/GRCh38_chr21.fa"
  gtf: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/references/references/GRCh38_chr21/GRCh38_chr21.gtf"
  source_version: "CUSTOM"
  readme: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/references/references/GRCh38_chr21/README.md"
  source: "nf-core/references"
  source_vcf: "GATK_BUNDLE"
  species: "Homo_sapiens"
  vcf: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/modules/data/genomics/homo_sapiens/genome/vcf/dbsnp_146.hg38.vcf.gz"
```

Each line represents a source for building a reference, a reference already built, or metadata.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/references \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input datasheet.yml \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/references/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/references/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/references/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
For more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the

### How to hack on it

0. Have docker, and Nextflow installed
1. `nextflow run main.nf`

### Some thoughts on reference building

- We could use the glob and if you just drop a fasta in s3 bucket it'll get picked up and new resources built
  - Could take this a step further and make it a little config file that has the fasta, gtf, genome_size etc.
- How do we avoid rebuilding? Ideally we should build once on a new minor release of an aligner/reference. IMO kinda low priority because the main cost is going to be egress, not compute.
- How much effort is too much effort?
  - Should it be as easy as adding a file on s3?
    - No that shouldn't be a requirement, should be able to link to a reference externally (A "source of truth" ie an FTP link), and the workflow will build the references
    - So like mulled biocontainers, just make a PR to the samplesheet and boom new reference in the s3 bucket if it's approved?

### Roadmap

PoC for v1.0:

- Replace aws-igenomes
  - bwa, bowtie2, star, bismark need to be built
  - fasta, gtf, bed12, mito_name, macs_gsize, blacklist, copied over

Other nice things to have:

- Building our test-datasets
- Down-sampling for a unified genomics test dataset creation, (Thinking about viralitegration/rnaseq/wgs) and spiking in test cases of interest (Specific variants for example)
